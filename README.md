# Object_Detection_yolo


Object detection is the field of computer vision that deals with the localization and classification of objects contained in an image or video. To put it simple terms object detection  comes down to drawing bounding boxes around detected objects which allow us to locate them in a given scene (or how they move through it) .Although the development  of object detection started as way back in 2001 when Paul Viola and Micheal Jones developed the Viola Jones detector which uses sliding window to go through all possible locations and scales in an image to see if any window contains any face, the sliding window searches for 'haar-like' features. Thanks to the advancement in computer vision object detection models are performing better than human eye, several models were developed to achieve this with the help of convolutional neural network. Such models are [Faster R-CNN](https://paperswithcode.com/method/faster-r-cnn), [Fast R-CNN](https://paperswithcode.com/method/fast-r-cnn],  [YOLO](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/you-only-look-once-unified-real-time-object), [YOLO_V2](https://paperswithcode.com/method/yolov2)
